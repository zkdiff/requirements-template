# Architecture

## Guiding Principles

<!-- 
High-level architectural decisions that shape the entire system.
These are the "non-negotiables" that all modules must respect.
-->

- **[Principle]**: [Explanation and rationale]
- **[Principle]**: [Explanation and rationale]

## System Context

<!-- 
How the system fits into its environment.
What's inside vs. outside the system boundary.
-->

## Component Overview

<!-- 
Major subsystems/components and their responsibilities.
Keep high-level; detailed design belongs in module docs or separate design docs.
-->

### [Component Name]

**Responsibility**: [What it does]

**Interfaces**: [How other components interact with it]

## Data Architecture

<!-- 
Key entities, ownership, and data flow principles.
Not a full data model—just enough to understand boundaries.
-->

## Security Architecture

<!-- 
Authentication, authorization, and data protection approaches.
